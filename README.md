# Social Network API

In this project I built an API for a social network applictaion that uses a NoSQL database. You are able to add friends, share thoughts and your friends are able to react to those thoughts. I am using Mongoose, MongoDB and Express.js as an alternative to MySQL. This project gives me a deeper understanding on building a full-stack application and how it may vary depending on the technology being used.

## How does it Work?

I have created a walkthough video that will help you undertsand the full functionality of what I have built. This demonstrates the working backend for a functioning Social Network applictaion.

The video will demonstrate the following:

- How to start the applications server
- The GET routes for all users & thoughts
- GET routes for grabbing a single user & single thought by id
- POST, DELETE and PUT routes for users & thoughts
- POST and DELETE routes for a user's friend list
- POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts
